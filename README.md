**Project: Natural Gas Price Prediction — Quantitative Research Simulation**

This project was completed as part of a JPMorgan quantitative research virtual job simulation. The objective was to model and predict natural gas price movements using Python-based numerical and visualization tools.

Key features:

Implemented linear regression and sinusoidal modeling to capture price trends and seasonal variations

Used NumPy for numerical computation and data transformation

Employed Matplotlib for visualizing historical price data and model predictions

Evaluated model performance and conducted exploratory price behavior analysis

This project demonstrates applied quantitative modeling, data-driven reasoning, and exploratory analysis aligned with energy market research in quantitative finance.
